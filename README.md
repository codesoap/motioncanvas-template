This is a small template for presentations about code using [Motion
Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io). It is mostly meant to serve to assist
my memory about how the basics of Motion Canvas work.

# Getting Started
To run locally, clone the project and do this in the root directory of
the repository; `node -v` must return a version >=16:

```bash
npm install
npm start
# Now visit http://localhost:9000/
```
